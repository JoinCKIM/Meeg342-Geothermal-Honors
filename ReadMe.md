## Analysis of Heat Transfer in a Geothermal Cooling System

This project was for the University of Delaware Meeg342 heat transfer honors project. The goal was to study a heat transfer topic. I looked at the problem formulation of a geothermal heat pump and implemented it a simple simulation in MATLAB. The full report, code, and pictures are all include in this repository.
